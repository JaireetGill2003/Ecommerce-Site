Project Features Explained in Depth:

The provided project is an E-commerce website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, encompassing both frontend and backend components. The frontend features an interactive user interface designed with HTML and styled using CSS. The dynamic behavior is implemented through JavaScript, with a significant enhancement from React State. The utilization of React State allows for seamless management of component-level state, ensuring real-time updates and a responsive user experience.

On the backend, the system incorporates a database interaction within the program. This integration enables the storage and retrieval of essential information, such as product details, prices, and user interactions. The backend, likely implemented using a technology like Node.js or a serverless framework, ensures persistent data storage and retrieval. The operational add-to-cart section reflects the comprehensive functionality of the program, complete with a total calculator that dynamically adjusts based on the selected items. Furthermore, the quantity changer facilitates easy customization of the desired quantity for each item.

Notably, the program exhibits a sophisticated system for item management, detecting whether an item has already been added to the cart and providing a functional delete item feature. This thorough implementation enhances the overall user experience, making the E-commerce website a robust and user-friendly platform for online shopping

How to Utilize Program:

To utilize the program, simply click on the black shopping icon corresponding to the item you wish to purchase. Then, navigate to the top right and click on the white shopping bag icon. This action adds the selected item to your virtual cart on the interactive website. Once in the cart, you can easily adjust the quantity by clicking on the number of items and increasing it from 1 to your desired quantity. The total amount dynamically updates as you modify the quantity, allowing you to experiment with various items simultaneously. To remove an item from your cart, click the red trash button, and the total will update accordingly. This intuitive process ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience while shopping on the website.
