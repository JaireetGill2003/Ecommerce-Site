# Ecommerce-Site

The provided project is an E-commerce website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, encompassing both frontend and backend components. The frontend features an interactive user interface designed with HTML and styled using CSS. The dynamic behavior is implemented through JavaScript, with a significant enhancement from React State. The utilization of React State allows for seamless management of component-level state, ensuring real-time updates and a responsive user experience.

On the backend, the system incorporates a database interaction within the program. This integration enables the storage and retrieval of essential information, such as product details, prices, and user interactions. The backend, likely implemented using a technology like Node.js or a serverless framework, ensures persistent data storage and retrieval. The operational add-to-cart section reflects the comprehensive functionality of the program, complete with a total calculator that dynamically adjusts based on the selected items. Furthermore, the quantity changer facilitates easy customization of the desired quantity for each item.

Notably, the program exhibits a sophisticated system for item management, detecting whether an item has already been added to the cart and providing a functional delete item feature. This thorough implementation enhances the overall user experience, making the E-commerce website a robust and user-friendly platform for online shopping
